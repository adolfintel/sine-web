## Some notes:
* To reduce the size of the archive, video files are not included. If you need them, you can download them from these URLs:
	* http://isochronic.io/videoTutorial/sine_editor_tut_en.m4v     (english, h264)
	* http://isochronic.io/videoTutorial/sine_editor_tut_en.webm     (english, webm)
	* http://isochronic.io/videoTutorial/sine_editor_tut_it.m4v     (italian, h264)
	* http://isochronic.io/videoTutorial/sine_editor_tut_it.webm     (italian, webm)
* Instead of the punBB forum, there's the anonymous comment system
* Passwords were removed from .php files, of course
* db.sql contains the commands to create the database: you will have to change the name of the db from 'DB' to whatever you want, and edit all the .php files to include the name, the host, and your username/password.
